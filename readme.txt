* Client side
* Upon clicking search, the react component displays the corresponding photos 
  from the server. When a photo is clicked on, its associated tags are displayed 
  on top of the photo. If there are currently 6 tags or less, the user is allowed 
  to add more tags until a maximum of seven is reached. If the limit is reached, 
  the user is not allowed to add any more tags.
